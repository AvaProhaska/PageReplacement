# PageReplacement
PageReplacement a java program. This program uses two page replacement algorithms, First In First Out (FIFO) and Least Recently Used (LRU) to compare which of the two policies provide the best output for the company we have been hired at. The PageReplacment program will take in the number of frames, pages, and Replacement string provided by user, and compare the fault rates between the two policies.
